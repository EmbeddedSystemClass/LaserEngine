## Moto housing - v2

The "*Agitation_motor_housing_v2.stl*" file seems to have scaling problems, causing it to appear 1000 times taller than it is. If in the software the piece is loaded with a size in the range of tens of meters, please scale it down to millimeters.



We provide "*Agitation_motor_housing_v2.3mf*" as an alternative, as in this format the piece seems to have the correct size.
