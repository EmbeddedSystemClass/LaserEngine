## Motor housing - v2

We provide two different designs:

- *Agitation_motor_housing_v2_10mmBearing* for a **5x10x4 mm** ball bearing
- *Agitation_motor_housing_v2_11mmBearing* for a **5x11x4 mm** ball bearing

The only difference is the ball bearing size. Each design is present as a .STEP and .STL file.

> Note that the STL files might be imported in 3D printer softwares with the wrong unit. If that is the case, for instance in meters, scale them down by a factor 1000. As a reference, the barrel (without the top handle) is 48 mm tall.
