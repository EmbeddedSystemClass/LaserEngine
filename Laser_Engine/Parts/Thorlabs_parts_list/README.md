## Thorlabs optical parts

In this folder, you can find three different files:

- [Thorlabs_Comments_on_items](Thorlabs_Comments_on_items.csv): a list of all optical elements for the main and LSR optical paths, with the quantity used (with and without LSR) and comments describing where is the item used in the optical path.
- [Thorlabs_Cart_WithoutLSR](Thorlabs_Cart_WithoutLSR.xls): a Thorlabs cart that can be directly uploaded to the website for ordering. This cart **does not include** the elements necessary to build the LSR system.
- [Thorlabs_Cart_WithLSR.xls](Thorlabs_Cart_WithLSR.xls): a Thorlabs cart that can be directly uploaded to the website for ordering. This cart **includes** the elements necessary to build the LSR system.
