## Voltage conditioning circuit

We describe two versions of the voltage conditioning board, versions A and B. They differ by the voltage divider part of the circuit and therefore are to be used with different laser diodes.

- **Version A**: This version corresponds to the 405 nm and 488 nm laser diodes. 
- **Version B**: This version corresponds to the 638 nm laser diodes.
